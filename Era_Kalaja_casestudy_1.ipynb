    "Assume you are new to the data science field, and you want to find out what real practitioners and soon-to-be data scientists are concerned about. One place where you may find such information is X (formerly known as Twitter). However, X users often use their real identities and may have reservations about sharing all their opinions publicly. Another place where such information maybe found is the datascience subreddit on Reddit.com (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Users are assumed to be anonymous and they are more likely to share their opinions without reservations. To find out common concerns among the datascience subreddit users, it might be a good idea to collect the top 100 posts in the subreddit in the year 2023. You might also collect the top 3 comments of each of those posts. In this case study, we will do exactly that. Specific details can be found in the next few cells. \n",

    "Once you have the mechanism in place to retrieve data from Reddit, you next step is to determine which parts of the data is necessary. For this case study, collect only the top posts from the year 2023. Also consider if the score of each post was above 50 or not. If the score was below 50, it might not have been an important post. Do not consider those posts. \n",

There’s a few grad school programs out there for HR Analytics.  So right now I’m just getting applications together and doing my research.  The program I’m really looking at seriosuly has a technological component to it as well which is important to me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are some jobs where you can make this a career but the HR field is notoriously behind the curve in these ways for way too many reasons not mentioned here.  That’s okay with me.  I am confident I’ll find a job and if it means taking a step back in my career or pay, that’s okay with me.  By the time I graduate I’ll be at an age where I don’t want to work so much anyway. \n",

      "\n",
      "***Data science as a normal job*** is just a rebranding of all those existing quantitative methods that you mentioned.  If you look at DS jobs at banks or insurance companies or logistics firms or CPG, they largely consist of the same data and modeling tasks that have always been done, just with a shiny coat of paint to attract the young un's, maybe with Python and R instead of Matlab or SAS.  They used to be called \"Statisticians\" or \"Quantitative Researchers\" or whatever.  I think this is more or less fine.     \n",
      "\n",
      "***Data science as a $300k/year job*** is a ZIRP phenomenon.  Sometimes I get the impression that prospective candidates and even gainfully employed data scientists are experiencing this sense of loss, of feeling like they missed out on this gold rush of the last 10 years, when it seemed like growth-crazed tech companies were handing out lucrative offers to anyone with a Kaggle profile and everyone else was forced to up their game to compete.  Not entirely sure it was ever that frothy, but admittedly, the barrier to entry \\*was\\* lower and the early movers did enjoy some good times.  Who cares if your newly-formed data science team never did anything worth a damn?  Those paychecks kept clearing anyway.\n",

Look for an organization where data science is part of the main product. Try to find companies that have the tech stack that you want to work in. Use glassdoor or ask entry level employees at the firms you are targeting about the early career mentoring experience. \\n\\nWe see similar threads on the disappointment of early career on this board as well. If you are data scientist number one with no IT support, maybe even no management support, you are going to have a bad time.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Some important points to consider, especially now that there are young people getting into the field as their first job, rather than the old physicist/economist/etc turning into data scientists. For those doing a bachelors degree in data science, and are entering this field as their first profession, it would be helpful to have a clear expectation of what the job is like.\\n\\nHowever, I think the opinions in the blogpost is misleading... and here is why:\\n\\n\\n**Re: Master of all trades, jack of none.**\\n\\nThere was an old saying about how data scientists are people who know more about computer science than statisticians, and know more about statistics than computer scientists. While this statement probably served the early data scientists, I think it may oversimplify the expectations somewhat.\\n\\nMost universities teach statistics with many electives in computing, and many computer science degree comes with statistics units as well. Most graduates wanting to be a data scientist come with both. To stand out, a data scientist needs to know equivalent statistics as a statistician, and have equivalent computing skills as a computer scientist. The famous Venn diagram should now consider the union, rather than the intersection.\\n\\nAnd yes, in my career so far, Excel, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Python, R, Scala, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Julia - were all \"used\". Though I must admit that I wad only an \"expert\" (better than others in the company) in Python, R, and Excel. I still had to fix SQL and other dashboards developed by others - so I guess I still had to know as much SQL as the data engineers in the organisation. Econometric analysis of time series for economics teams, developing serverless APIs on the cloud, developing ETL/ELT pipelines, designing OLAP databases, conducting Bayesian survival analysis, designing a custom interactive visualisation using JavaScript, estimating driving distances between sets of millions of different postcodes, natural language processing, facilitaing workshops to develop data strategies, teaching data analysts how to use R, identifying why two PowerBI dashboards were showing different numbers, optimising a SQL query that was clogging up the data warehouse, ... there was no limit to the range of tasks.\\n\\nIn each of those roles, we are expected to be as much of an expert as the previous person who was supposedly an \"expert\". We're brought in because there is an issue. Which means that the expectation is that we can understand and fix whatever the expert had done. I could go on forever with these tasks that are seemingly outside the duties of a data scientist. I hope that some day I data scientists can be specialised to just one set of tasks. But if everything else in the domain of data was functioning, I wouldn't need to be called upon to fix things. So I need to dabble in tasks other than exploring data and modelling.\\n\\n\\n**Re: No or inadequate data infrastructure.**\\n\\nJust going by the description in the post, I am going to assume that the author never actually got to be a data scientist. Unfortunate, that he had to give up before even getting a taste of what it would have been like. Google Drive and SharePoint? Don't tell me all the analysis was done in Excel and PowerPoint... I would have asked during the interview what their tech stack is.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Expectations vs reality of being a data scientist.**\\n\\nOf course the cleaning of data is a regular part of the job. Same goes with physcists, chemists, biologists, etc. who need to painstakingly conduct experiments. Meticulously cleaning and maintaining all equipments. Data collection can take weeks, months, and even years. Analysis and modelling maybe takes days. I know because I used to be a chemist/physicist.\\n\\nIf you want clean tabular data just handed to you, you should become an econometrician or a political scientist - other people will do all the data collection for you, and more often than not, clean it for you too. I know because I had to fulfill these data requests for them. (sometimes do the analysis too - because Stata couldn't handle a million rows of data)\\n\\n\\n**Re: Customer service agents**\\n\\nData science is a non-essential, enabling job - not the core business. We are always servicing our clients or stakeholders. Management need to manage workloads and priorities. This balancing act is similar in other areas. Positive takeaway is that data specialists are always needed, one way or another.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Isolation and monotony**\\n\\nThis point, again, applies to many jobs - especially since the pandemic. Meaningful relationships are hard to forge. If it is of any positive - it makes it easier to hop to another job if a better opportunity comes by.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Lack of guidance from senior data scientists and domain experts**\\n\\nLack of guidance is unfortunate, and I have experienced this too. But I would consider this as a plus in retrospect. With this freedom, you could forge your own path, and be able to follow (via the internet) who you consider to be great data scientists.\\n\\nAt least in the \"early days\" of the \"boom\" there weren't many \"seniors\" that one could learn from. More bluntly, I would consider most seniors to be incompetent at worst, and not-really-someone-I-should-learn-from at best. This relates to the first point about being a unicorn. If you don't have a unicorn senior data scientist, you can't learn to be a unicorn data scientist from them.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Politics**\\n\\nUnfortunately, the issue of office politics is universal as well.\\n\\n\\nI guess what I am saying is, that the author's experience, or his conclusions from them, are not a 100% relatable or agreeable. Sure, this job isn't all rosy, but neither are other jobs.</td>\n",

start to understand strongly typed languages. When I can I use parquet or other formats that store the data type with the data.   \n",

                I mean that would be great, if it was any less than a crapshoot to land a legit entry level DS/DA job with no Bachelor’s degree or other relevant experience.\\n\\nNo you don’t need a degree to learn the skills necessary to do the job. Yes college is overpriced and often behind the curve on new skills/tech. And yes I know people who have had this turn out well for them. But being able to do the job is not the same as being able to land the job, and with the competition in the space right now I think young aspiring DS/DAs should approach this advice with caution.\\n\\nI notice that a lot of the loudest voices saying you don’t need a degree are the ones who have an alternative to promote. I wonder why that is?   \n",

       "110  Some important points to consider, especially now that there are young people getting into the field as their first job, rather than the old physicist/economist/etc turning into data scientists. For those doing a bachelors degree in data science, and are entering this field as their first profession, it would be helpful to have a clear expectation of what the job is like.\\n\\nHowever, I think the opinions in the blogpost is misleading... and here is why:\\n\\n\\n**Re: Master of all trades, jack of none.**\\n\\nThere was an old saying about how data scientists are people who know more about computer science than statisticians, and know more about statistics than computer scientists. While this statement probably served the early data scientists, I think it may oversimplify the expectations somewhat.\\n\\nMost universities teach statistics with many electives in computing, and many computer science degree comes with statistics units as well. Most graduates wanting to be a data scientist come with both. To stand out, a data scientist needs to know equivalent statistics as a statistician, and have equivalent computing skills as a computer scientist. The famous Venn diagram should now consider the union, rather than the intersection.\\n\\nAnd yes, in my career so far, Excel, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Python, R, Scala, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Julia - were all \"used\". Though I must admit that I wad only an \"expert\" (better than others in the company) in Python, R, and Excel. I still had to fix SQL and other dashboards developed by others - so I guess I still had to know as much SQL as the data engineers in the organisation. Econometric analysis of time series for economics teams, developing serverless APIs on the cloud, developing ETL/ELT pipelines, designing OLAP databases, conducting Bayesian survival analysis, designing a custom interactive visualisation using JavaScript, estimating driving distances between sets of millions of different postcodes, natural language processing, facilitaing workshops to develop data strategies, teaching data analysts how to use R, identifying why two PowerBI dashboards were showing different numbers, optimising a SQL query that was clogging up the data warehouse, ... there was no limit to the range of tasks.\\n\\nIn each of those roles, we are expected to be as much of an expert as the previous person who was supposedly an \"expert\". We're brought in because there is an issue. Which means that the expectation is that we can understand and fix whatever the expert had done. I could go on forever with these tasks that are seemingly outside the duties of a data scientist. I hope that some day I data scientists can be specialised to just one set of tasks. But if everything else in the domain of data was functioning, I wouldn't need to be called upon to fix things. So I need to dabble in tasks other than exploring data and modelling.\\n\\n\\n**Re: No or inadequate data infrastructure.**\\n\\nJust going by the description in the post, I am going to assume that the author never actually got to be a data scientist. Unfortunate, that he had to give up before even getting a taste of what it would have been like. Google Drive and SharePoint? Don't tell me all the analysis was done in Excel and PowerPoint... I would have asked during the interview what their tech stack is.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Expectations vs reality of being a data scientist.**\\n\\nOf course the cleaning of data is a regular part of the job. Same goes with physcists, chemists, biologists, etc. who need to painstakingly conduct experiments. Meticulously cleaning and maintaining all equipments. Data collection can take weeks, months, and even years. Analysis and modelling maybe takes days. I know because I used to be a chemist/physicist.\\n\\nIf you want clean tabular data just handed to you, you should become an econometrician or a political scientist - other people will do all the data collection for you, and more often than not, clean it for you too. I know because I had to fulfill these data requests for them. (sometimes do the analysis too - because Stata couldn't handle a million rows of data)\\n\\n\\n**Re: Customer service agents**\\n\\nData science is a non-essential, enabling job - not the core business. We are always servicing our clients or stakeholders. Management need to manage workloads and priorities. This balancing act is similar in other areas. Positive takeaway is that data specialists are always needed, one way or another.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Isolation and monotony**\\n\\nThis point, again, applies to many jobs - especially since the pandemic. Meaningful relationships are hard to forge. If it is of any positive - it makes it easier to hop to another job if a better opportunity comes by.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Lack of guidance from senior data scientists and domain experts**\\n\\nLack of guidance is unfortunate, and I have experienced this too. But I would consider this as a plus in retrospect. With this freedom, you could forge your own path, and be able to follow (via the internet) who you consider to be great data scientists.\\n\\nAt least in the \"early days\" of the \"boom\" there weren't many \"seniors\" that one could learn from. More bluntly, I would consider most seniors to be incompetent at worst, and not-really-someone-I-should-learn-from at best. This relates to the first point about being a unicorn. If you don't have a unicorn senior data scientist, you can't learn to be a unicorn data scientist from them.\\n\\n\\n**Re: Politics**\\n\\nUnfortunately, the issue of office politics is universal as well.\\n\\n\\nI guess what I am saying is, that the author's experience, or his conclusions from them, are not a 100% relatable or agreeable. Sure, this job isn't all rosy, but neither are other jobs.   \n",

scientist at companies.  Ageism is real and no need to BS about it.  By the way, I am almost 50 but have been data science/analyst for 20 yrs.  However, your experience in business analysis and finance is a huge plus!  You should leverage your business acumen and apply for opportunities that require management of teams in data science.  I would  focus on making you have a strong knowledge of the end-to-end process. In data science project management, your age and experience is going to take you far  The other alternative focus purely on the fintech and financial data science and apply for jobs at senior level that may be slightly outside of your skillsset but if you specialize in that niche of data science its possible.   \n",
