No you don’t need a degree to learn the skills necessary to do the job. Yes college is overpriced and often behind the curve on new skills/tech. And yes I know people who have had this turn out well for them. But being able to do the job is not the same as being able to land the job, and with the competition in the space right now I think young aspiring DS/DAs should approach this advice with caution.

Let them play & waste their money while pretending to do something meaningful/useful with their lives. They will get bored soon enough.,"Where I work, we closed a deal with Google to use absurd amounts of compute to build foundational models for synthetic biology. Basically LLMs for DNA and RNA engineering. There's no FOMO, just a lot of enthusiasm.","Amid all the criticism of mgmt pushing LLM based work on DS teams, I’d like to offer the counter point. The FOMO is mainly driven by two factors I think

1. What used to be months of work collecting labeled data, training and fine tuning models, deploying on kubernetes at scale, is currently just an API call away for many NLP problems. This tremendously speeds up development and requires a much smaller team to develop and maintain. Being lean is all the rage in the business world, hence the interest to capitulate on this

2. Endless “thought leadership” on how GenAI will disrupt and transform entire industries so everyone is afraid their business would get completely obliterated. The utter and complete destruction of the print media with the rise of the smartphone is fresh in most senior management’s memory and they don’t want the same thing happening to them this time. 

I say use this fomo to your advantage. If you can curry favour from senior leadership by building one of their project on the side, it’ll help your career in the long run."

But another takeaway is that you got (at least) 4 properly-qualified applicants and another 2 maybe-overqualified applicants from 12 hours' worth of applications. So if you left the posting up for a week, you'd probably get more qualified applicants than you'd ever want to interview, albeit not until after wading through 1000+ obviously unviable ones.",How will I get my Data science job with all these scary tales,">Two were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list.

They still don't really have a way to address the largest issue which is that it can be tremendously hard to maximize machine utilization in python due to the GIL, and doing so requires time-consuming backflips to avoid python code. 

All I want is to saturate my workstation's cores when processing data, every time, without having to think about it. I don't need something insane and large like spark, just a programming environment that isn't hobbled by bad decisions where parallelization works the way it should, constant factors are low on strings and common data structures, and there is zero penalty for ""using the language"". I just want to see 3200% CPU in \`top\` when I'm waiting for steps to run. Is that so much to ask? 

The downside of Rust is that it's a pretty picky language to code in. Nothing's perfect, but I write the code for production batch pipelines once and wait for it to run hundreds or thousands of times, so spending a little longer up front generally works out for me .",Polars ✌️

If you're really so career focused that you have the blinders on 24/7 for real life, idk maybe talk to a therapist, or try getting a hobby/volunteering. At worst, you might become a more well rounded and interesting person. At best you might be more efficient at work and probably a more pleasant co-worker.

I've been looking at 2-3 different online MS-DS programs from accredited non-profits.  After weeding out programs that were a bad fit or didn't look serious, all of the remaining possibilities require courses in statistics and SQL.  I'd have to look again, but I don't think any of them are advertised as 1 year programs.  I can't speak to whether they make you solve real programming problems or not at this point.

So, this raises 2 questions for me:

1.  What do you consider to be a prestigious university and where's the cutoff before it becomes too undistinguished, and therefor a scam in your opinion?
2. If the university isn't prestigious by your definition, but they do require significant coursework in statistics and SQL, and aren't advertised as 1 year programs, how likely are they to be a scam?",I feel ya.

39,2023-09-08 19:45:54,484,R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,"From my experience **Python excels** (vs R) when you move to writing production-grade code:

- in my experience base Python (dicts, lists, iterating strings letter by letter) are much faster than base types in R
- better OOP system than R's set of S3/S4/R6
- function decorators
- context managers
- asynchronous i/o
- type hinting and checking (R has a package typing that has something along these lines but nowhere to the level what Python has in terms of say Pydantic and mypy)
- far more elaborate set of linting tools, e.g. black and flake8 trump anything in R
- new versions and features coming far more quickly than R
- data orchestration/automation tools that work out of the box, e.g. Airflow, Prefect (stupid easy learning curve, slap few decorators and you have your workflow)
- version pinning, e.g. pyenv, poetry,  basically reproducible workflows
- massive community support, unlike R, Python doesn't rely on one company (Posit) and bunch of academics to keep it alive. 
- FAANG companies have interest in developing not only Python packages but language itself, even more so with Global Interpreter Lock removal
- web scraping, interfacing with various APIs even as common as AWS is a lot smoother in Python
- PySpark >>> SparkR/sparklyr
- PyPI >>> CRAN (CRAN submission is like a bad joke from stone age,  CRAN doesn't support Linux binaries(!!!)


**R excels** in maybe lower number of other places, typically statistical tools, specific-domain support (e.g. bioinformatics/comp bio) and exploratory data analysis, but in things it is better it is just *so good*:

- the number of stats packages is far beyond anything in Python
- the number of bioinformatics packages is FAR beyond Python (especially on Bioconductor)
- tidyverse (dplyr/tidyr especially) destroys every single thing I tried in Python, pandas here looks like a bad joke in comparison
- delayed evaluation, especially in function arguments, results in some crazy things you can do wrt metaprogramming (e.g. package rlang is incredible, allows you to easily take the user provided code apart, supplement it, then just evaluate it in whatever environment you want... which I am sure breaks bunch of good coding practices but damn is it useful) 
- data.table syntax way cleaner than polars (again thanks to clever implementation of tidy evaluation and R-specific features)
- Python's plotnine is good, but ggplot2 is still king - the number of additional gg* packages allows you to make some incredible visualizations that are very hard to do in Python
- super-fluid integration with RMarkdown (although now Quarto is embracing Python so this point may be moot)
- even though renv is a little buggy in my experience, RStudio/Posit Package Manager is fantastic
- RStudio under very active development and IDE for exploratory work is in some specific ways better than anything for Python including VSCode (e.g. it recognizes data.frame/data.table/tibble contexts and column names and previews are available via tabbing)","I wouldn’t build a web server with R. But anything with statistics I would use R. Practically, I would use python for data acquisition. Web scraping, API interaction, automated SQL stuff. But then use R to create models and run analytics on that acquired data.","I'll tell you why python is the better of the two languages for me: some of my coworkers know it.

I'm one of 2 data scientists at a company of 50-ish people that consists largely of software developers. Most of my work is part of our product (as opposed to business intelligence). Even if I'm the one doing the ""data science"" of developing a model, putting it into production is a team effort. It's important that my coworkers can, for example, set up python virtual environments and modify the parts of code that manage credentials. Python is also supported natively by technologies such as AWS lambda that we use."

If they dislike probabilities, for example, if they have a ""just give me a simple yes or no"" attitude, or if they only want simple descriptives in flashy dashboards... it just feels like you end up not doing anything meaningful or deep with the data, and instead end up like serving their confirmation bias, dumbing down any potential analysis and inference, and accommodating to their non-analytical aesthetical needs.","Because the pay is worse, the work is arguably not as respected, and DS provides more optionality for future roles.

IMO, at a big company, the value that a great BA/DA adds over an average one can be greater than the incremental value of a great DS or MLE over an average one. But that's a pretty idiosyncratic take, and the way companies pay BAs/DAs makes it crystal clear that they don't agree with me.","I think it's the thought that 'DS is the sexiest job from this decade'.

47,2023-05-23 04:48:39,434,Job is a nightmare - Advice,"It sounds like they’re skipping the step of hiring a data engineer. You’re not meant to be juggling systems. As you’ve said, and it sounds like they’ve agreed, you want to analyse data, get insights and maybe transform them into actionable objectives. 

First suggestion; get looking for another job. They’re naive and young and while you can learn a lot of skills if you manage this correctly, they probably won’t appreciate what you’re achieving by doing so.

Second suggestion; while you’re looking for a new job, take advantage of the heap of responsibility that has been balanced on your shoulders. Having some data engineering skills on your CV would serve you well. Tell your manager that you can’t help them benefit from their data until their data is in an orderly condition. Support your statement with links and evidence, and most importantly, research and bring the solutions to them. Do not bring problems. (1) they won’t know how to handle them (2) they will think you’re making excuses. 

You’ll need some data pipelines and if you want them off your back for a little bit, invest some time in PowerBI. Build some pretty graphs and they’ll be eating out of your hand. Remember that half the battle of dealing with stakeholders is presenting the information to them in a way that they understand and unfortunately even bad information is received better in a nice dashboard over groundbreaking information.

I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to DM me for more information, if I can help, I will. As a woman in DS, I’ve experienced the stress and anxiety you’re going through (probably with a sprinkle of imposter syndrome too). 

Good luck OP ☺️",Try to automate as much as you can from the presentations and maybe do an ingestion pipeline that would connect and ingest the data from the 5 systems into 1 where you can handle it better. Set boundaries. Don't work unpaid overtime.,"1. Set work hours. Say you got a Pilates thing after and you pay good money to not skip it.

2. Enforce boundaries at work.

3. Don’t take work outside of your work hours. Hard workers get more work and not more pay unless you overemploy, but that’s not the right job to OE.

4. Most jobs suck and will be a bad fit. Navigate that environment and learn to appreciate the game if you can.

Now, because ""they know better"", you may have to switch to a more stiffed tone, which is definitely annoying and exhausting. But I think it is par of the course for a manager, to be able to have more ""difficult"" conversations.

Also assess whether some of their criticism is valid in regards to specific problems at hand. Do remind them that experience is highly valued in this (your) company, and that professional courtesy is expected. That being able to be part of a team and work together is one of the key skills they were looking for when hiring for their position.

Give them two to four weeks, and if they don't show any improvement, well, start looking for someone else.","I think folks are being a little harsh. We were all new to the workforce at one point, and we all made dumb mistakes.  Personally, I think direct and honest communication is best.

My expectation is that I won't hear you speaking negatively about any of our teammates.  Is that something you can do?""

Regarding butting heads, sometimes this happens, but for the most part, it should not. Again, direct communication is the way.  On the other hand, if they think they have a better way, give them a bit of time to try it out. They either learn a lesson or you get a better solution.

Then you have a fresh grad, pummelled through a master's and PhD. New to the corporate side of things, but chock full of the newest research and practices being taught.

You can't discredit 15 years of experience just because of the baseline education. You also can't discount the dedicated time to achieve a PhD and the research mindset they have. 


It needs to be a conversation of ""While your solution WOULD improve the model and you are correct, the current budget and time constraints require us to continue pursuing XYZ. Please continue bringing solutions to us, and as a team we will see what is feasible to implement in the future.""

There’s also product strategy focused DS that doesn’t require SWE skills but can still pay very well and add enormous business value. Many people would call them “just DAs” or “SQL monkeys” but the typical strong DA or product DS will have far more face time with the director, VP, and SVP product leadership layer of the company than the typical strong MLE. They can use that experience to jump into the DS director layer and be less limited by the absence of SWE skills. However you have to essentially operate as a management consultant or product manager that’s unusually data driven. 

While I have good SWE skills — I’ve deployed production ML models and been fully integrated into the software development teams of FANNG SWEs — and I have very strong stats skills — I’m on the “technical” side of the DS divide at Google — I deeply respect the non-technical DA-type DS.

You can have amazing technical and mathematical skills but if you suck at communication, no one (important) will know and that will hinder your career. 

What we want data science to be and what the business actually needs are often two different things. 

Most businesses will never hire as many data scientists/analysts as they truly need because we don’t make money. My company easily has enough work/demand for our DS/analytics team to be 2x its size or more. But we don’t build the product so budget for new positions almost always goes to software eng. Or data eng. I think this got lost in the “data scientist is the most in demand job.” Just because it’s in demand doesn’t mean every company will hire as many people as they need.

Most DS jobs are focused on making more money. Without capitalism/profits, this field would just be a small subset of something else.","All the fun stuff is expensive so you need to either

* Leave to places that do it
* Fight an uphill battle in your org to make money free for it
* Make peace with the fact you're not going to do it"
66,2023-05-09 13:07:55,367,PSA: You don't need fancy stuff to do good work.,"Tools are created to solve problems. If you haven't encountered those problems it isn't obvious why you should use a (more advanced) tool over an obvious approach.

People tend to go in different directions:

* camp A follows the flavour of the month and they're stuck with a microservices architecture running on managed k8s in the cloud that creates *no* value whatsoever. They're doing it for the sake of doing it.
* Camp B wants to do everything in the simplest way possible which means they're forever doing the same thing be it Excel, notebooks, data warehousing or dashboards  (depending on their maturity) even when there's room to grow in IT/data maturity and create more value.

Both are bad.

**Something that I think about is the correlation between big tech and their fancy stuff.** Is the relationship causal in the sense that: big tech -> fancy stuff *or* is it fancy stuff -> big tech.

You can rule the latter out because managed K8S doesn't magically bring you to FAANG's revenue. What we can say however is that big tech isn't shy of using advanced tools/methods when they're necessary so the approach of camp B is certainly wrong as well.

I think it's all down to realising that you're in *science* which means that you need to experiment within your domain and also (on a small scale) with your tools.","As long time emacs user (I primarily use VScode now), I think you discredit yourself by arguing that simplicity is key and, oh yeah, the average DS should use VIM or emacs 😀.

More seriously, I think the part that is missing is investing in domain knowledge.

68,2023-02-05 14:58:27,367,isn't this just too much for a take home assignment?,"At first I thought this was homework, for which I was like, “yeah that’s totally reasonable especially if you’re given up to two weeks for it,” but no, as a take home exercise for an application, I agree that this is just doing their work for them. Not to say that a role can’t have a take home challenge, but I would trim it down *a lot* and suggest the candidate focus on one or two of those tasks for their proof of competence","I’m generally not a fan of open-ended take home assignments; they disproportionately favor candidates with more free time, e.g. young, child-free, etc. You can imagine the many ways in which they ignore great candidates with other responsibilities.

It’s hard to say if this is fair without knowing the complexity of the algorithm they’re asking you to develop (or are you only evaluating a given one?) That said, the rest of this doesn’t seem totally crazy to me. For example, assuming it’s done in Python, I would expect a senior-level candidate to:

- be able to easily create Python package to make this reproducible (reproducible in most cases of course, bonus point for writing a Docker file but *absolutely* not expected)
- write clean, commented code in a script
- run said script on given data
- generate a few useful plots
- summarize in a slide
- outline thoughts on deployment, not actually deploying. IMO this just gives them an idea of where you’re at in terms of deployment. If the answer is “hand off to ML engineer”, that’s fine. That may or may not suite their needs. 

This is a good-faith interpretation of the assignment. And again, it really depends on what kind of analysis they’re asking you to do, but the rest of this is very reasonable to me and in line with your average take home assignment. I’d expect any work from a senior candidate to meet these guidelines.

The problem is that the actual analysis is probably open-ended and could take an indefinite number hours, and that bullshit favors people with an indefinite amount of free time.","I posted this on another thread here before, but thought I would share my experience with you: 

I made this mistake for a major insurer. Applied, recruiter spoke to me for 5 min to explain the ""practice set"". I spent 30 hours on that damn set. I then didn't even get an interview. They said my AUC was 0.1 too low (my AUC was 0.82, their cutoff was 0.9 I later found out), I missed the cutoff for an interview. I was devastated. Such a massive waste of my time and huge moral killer. Took me a long time to recover from that blow. Now, I flat out refuse unless it's the last step and I really want the position.

The challenge is that it takes a significant time investment to develop statistical intuition, domain knowledge, and technical know-how, but he is right to point out that methods seem overemphasized in the field.","Yes -- almost every bad project I've seen has had two primary elements:

1. Analysts starting at machine learning rather than basic statistics and/or rules-based modeling.
2. Failure to understand the data and how it relates to the business problem.

Once you understand the data and the purpose, frankly, 95% of the time the modeling is easy.

I see it as fundamentally a principal-agent problem. Via Occam's razor, the best solution is the simplest one, but the simplest one will almost certainly make the analyst look less smart/cool compared to the AI/ML, Agile and Cloud (insert more buzzwords here) solution.

Same problem when I was in academic economics, so much advanced math and the DSGE models don't forecast anything well.","Yeah, I do. But you have to keep in mind this quote came from someone for whom the methods are easy and this stuff is the hard part.

The responsibilities won’t change much, just the title.","To me, it's better to separate out two distinct things: 

***Data science as a normal job*** is just a rebranding of all those existing quantitative methods that you mentioned.  If you look at DS jobs at banks or insurance companies or logistics firms or CPG, they largely consist of the same data and modeling tasks that have always been done, just with a shiny coat of paint to attract the young un's, maybe with Python and R instead of Matlab or SAS.  They used to be called ""Statisticians"" or ""Quantitative Researchers"" or whatever.  I think this is more or less fine.     

***Data science as a $300k/year job*** is a ZIRP phenomenon.  Sometimes I get the impression that prospective candidates and even gainfully employed data scientists are experiencing this sense of loss, of feeling like they missed out on this gold rush of the last 10 years, when it seemed like growth-crazed tech companies were handing out lucrative offers to anyone with a Kaggle profile and everyone else was forced to up their game to compete.  Not entirely sure it was ever that frothy, but admittedly, the barrier to entry \*was\* lower and the early movers did enjoy some good times.  Who cares if your newly-formed data science team never did anything worth a damn?  Those paychecks kept clearing anyway.

This era is done.  Of course, you can still get a high-paying job.  But it'll be more like becoming a surgeon: specialized training and experience that is only valuable at a small handful of companies.  But for everyone else, ""data science as a normal job"" will still be there, just like GPs are still around and necessary.","This is a very confusing post.  You say Data Science is a fad, but I think you mean the term 'Data Science' is a fad because like you pointed out, there have been other terms used in different times to describe using data, math, and programming to optimize business solutions.

Experience.

While I'm not a hiring manager at an F50 I am a data scientist at an F50 that's been involved in the hiring process for multiple other data scientists, including Junior positions. Before this I worked at another multi-billion dollar insurance company that hired tons of data scientists.

In my personal opinion, if you're looking to get a data scientist position and you didn't go to some elite school the single best decision you could make would be to get experience in data as either a data analyst, junior database administrator, or data engineer.  

Yes, I know your degree says data science.  That doesn't mean you're ready for a data scientist position. Put in a few years as a data analyst and it will be far easier for you to get a data scientist position either at your current company or new company.

For our Junior data scientist positions we hired exactly one person who had no experience, but it just finished grad school. That person did come from a top tier School. All of the other Juniors that we hired had some level of experience (beyond just an internship) as data analysts before.","Excellent post to address the endless stream of posts from people trying to break into data science. It’s important to remember that part of what makes a top tier program is that they are integrated into a network of business, government, and academic institutions. These programs are recruited from for internships, have researchers collaborating with name recognized companies and government agencies.

It is not yet a perfect replacement for a good old Google search.

Certain topics/domains are less fraught than others, but I’ve found the further I descend into a “dialogue” with followup after followup, the more my specific questions begin to lead the model and influence its responses, which is bad news if I’m treating them as a source of truth. At a certain point, the context your dialogue provides seems to start to influence the generated responses so much that it can even just start parroting you to a degree.

Use ChatGPT. That’s what it’s for. But always remember that the model doesn’t actually “know” anything at all. It is not a database or a repository of facts. It’s just a very fancy stochastic text generator. Hallucinations are very real and happen all the time, big and small.

Edit: Typos.

Edit: Here’s a simple example where, with just one round of back-and-forth (crucially involving a challenge to the model’s initial response), I led it to claim something preposterous and divorced from reality:

\* This example is GPT-3.5. 4 is better, but the base claim of “be careful because these models don’t actually know anything” is just as true. These models are just text generators, not infallible teachers."

111,2023-02-04 18:39:30,284,"Expectations for Data Scientists, a very interesting perspective","The author's issues really come down to advice often given by those answering questions in the weekly thread for what to look for in the first role. Look for an organization where data science is part of the main product. Try to find companies that have the tech stack that you want to work in. Use glassdoor or ask entry level employees at the firms you are targeting about the early career mentoring experience. 

We see similar threads on the disappointment of early career on this board as well. If you are data scientist number one with no IT support, maybe even no management support, you are going to have a bad time.","Some important points to consider, especially now that there are young people getting into the field as their first job, rather than the old physicist/economist/etc turning into data scientists. For those doing a bachelors degree in data science, and are entering this field as their first profession, it would be helpful to have a clear expectation of what the job is like.

However, I think the opinions in the blogpost is misleading... and here is why:


**Re: Master of all trades, jack of none.**

There was an old saying about how data scientists are people who know more about computer science than statisticians, and know more about statistics than computer scientists. While this statement probably served the early data scientists, I think it may oversimplify the expectations somewhat.

Most universities teach statistics with many electives in computing, and many computer science degree comes with statistics units as well. Most graduates wanting to be a data scientist come with both. To stand out, a data scientist needs to know equivalent statistics as a statistician, and have equivalent computing skills as a computer scientist. The famous Venn diagram should now consider the union, rather than the intersection.

And yes, in my career so far, Excel, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Python, R, Scala, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Julia - were all ""used"". Though I must admit that I wad only an ""expert"" (better than others in the company) in Python, R, and Excel. I still had to fix SQL and other dashboards developed by others - so I guess I still had to know as much SQL as the data engineers in the organisation. Econometric analysis of time series for economics teams, developing serverless APIs on the cloud, developing ETL/ELT pipelines, designing OLAP databases, conducting Bayesian survival analysis, designing a custom interactive visualisation using JavaScript, estimating driving distances between sets of millions of different postcodes, natural language processing, facilitaing workshops to develop data strategies, teaching data analysts how to use R, identifying why two PowerBI dashboards were showing different numbers, optimising a SQL query that was clogging up the data warehouse, ... there was no limit to the range of tasks.

In each of those roles, we are expected to be as much of an expert as the previous person who was supposedly an ""expert"". We're brought in because there is an issue. Which means that the expectation is that we can understand and fix whatever the expert had done. I could go on forever with these tasks that are seemingly outside the duties of a data scientist. I hope that some day I data scientists can be specialised to just one set of tasks. But if everything else in the domain of data was functioning, I wouldn't need to be called upon to fix things. So I need to dabble in tasks other than exploring data and modelling.


**Re: No or inadequate data infrastructure.**

Just going by the description in the post, I am going to assume that the author never actually got to be a data scientist. Unfortunate, that he had to give up before even getting a taste of what it would have been like. Google Drive and SharePoint? Don't tell me all the analysis was done in Excel and PowerPoint... I would have asked during the interview what their tech stack is.


**Re: Expectations vs reality of being a data scientist.**

Of course the cleaning of data is a regular part of the job. Same goes with physcists, chemists, biologists, etc. who need to painstakingly conduct experiments. Meticulously cleaning and maintaining all equipments. Data collection can take weeks, months, and even years. Analysis and modelling maybe takes days. I know because I used to be a chemist/physicist.

If you want clean tabular data just handed to you, you should become an econometrician or a political scientist - other people will do all the data collection for you, and more often than not, clean it for you too. I know because I had to fulfill these data requests for them. (sometimes do the analysis too - because Stata couldn't handle a million rows of data)


**Re: Customer service agents**

Data science is a non-essential, enabling job - not the core business. We are always servicing our clients or stakeholders. Management need to manage workloads and priorities. This balancing act is similar in other areas. Positive takeaway is that data specialists are always needed, one way or another.


**Re: Isolation and monotony**

This point, again, applies to many jobs - especially since the pandemic. Meaningful relationships are hard to forge. If it is of any positive - it makes it easier to hop to another job if a better opportunity comes by.


**Re: Lack of guidance from senior data scientists and domain experts**

Lack of guidance is unfortunate, and I have experienced this too. But I would consider this as a plus in retrospect. With this freedom, you could forge your own path, and be able to follow (via the internet) who you consider to be great data scientists.

At least in the ""early days"" of the ""boom"" there weren't many ""seniors"" that one could learn from. More bluntly, I would consider most seniors to be incompetent at worst, and not-really-someone-I-should-learn-from at best. This relates to the first point about being a unicorn. If you don't have a unicorn senior data scientist, you can't learn to be a unicorn data scientist from them.


**Re: Politics**

Unfortunately, the issue of office politics is universal as well.
